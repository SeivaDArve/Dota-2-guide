When attempting to pull a creep camp and the timming is not correct, to prevent the creep to come back to its area before time, just net them to wait outside

are you going on a dangerous team fight? use a meepo with low heath to wait outside a camp... if the enemy roots your main meepo, the second meepo can deny both by walking into creeps

dont forget to bait, when at night, our creeps destroy their tower without contest.... 

Block enemy path with one meepo and hit with the others
