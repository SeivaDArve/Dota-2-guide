# Title: Do not forget this possibilities (for each hero)

* Pugna
Do not forget to:
- Deny yourself if needed (spare 1 TP scroll; do jot die in a gank; etc)
- Take all Tormentors alone (this hero must do it)
- Nether ward before a gank (to minimize the change of 1 enemy escape with only 5% helth)
- Nether ward as observer ward on top of hills, with a centry to de-ward the enemy
