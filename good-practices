Good Practices (every game):
 - Get you currier closer to lower grownd (At the beggingin of the game, as soon as game loads, for faster delivery)
 - To escape with TP, remember to do so in higher ground or within trees (if possible, on wards high grounds)
 - Cut trees on your path, do not go around trees with Cuiling Blade (and use Shift to cue the next location after the tree is cut)
 - Always abuse your items
