Funcoes de um support:

- Block creep camps
  - Body block
  - Block with centries before the minute 00:00
- Balance lane creeps while the core farms
  - AT MINUTE 00:00 SUPPORT CAN BLOCK ENEMY LANE CREEPS, it will make the safe lane creeps meet under tower and the tower will kill offlane creeps very fast... so the next wave will meet perfectly close to offlaner tower with the first safe lane creeps and the second offlane creeps. This avoids so many creep agro and creep pulling to banance the lane in favor to the offlaner. Some supports who do this, also do the centry trick on the tier 2 tower, when the safe lane creeps pass next to it, the tower will spot the centry, creeps will atack it and delay the lane, so agains, the creeps will meet under tower
  - Maybe we need to steal creeps by cutting their wave
- Prevent the enemy support from balancing the lane for himself
  - Sometimes the item WindLace helps a lot to contest 
- Respawn
   - Refil BOTTLEs of our mid laners when we respawn (by TP to mid)
   - Carry our core's item to side lane if good comunication happens and he drops the item on the fountain to be carried by us instead of the currier
- get away from our core as much as possible to prevent stealling his XP
- Smoke at the beggining of the match
  - Carry smokes and dusts
- Get closer to river runes at it's timmings to help the mid laner secure them
- pull creep camps every minute
- scout for enemies in their jungle
- deward enemy wards
  - We can use our currier to spot centries on high grounds
- when enemy heros are in view range and we spot wards or centries in their inventory, keep checking if they place them
- Try to get enemy XP runes
- Scout for enemy pulled camps (to rob them)
- Around 20 min mark, check your carry's items timmings, and if his items are already built, remind the whole team to take roshan and to pressure towers after that 
- Keep our core full health full mana
- Block first creep wave at minute 00:00 for our offlaner all the way from the base to the enemy lane. If we die, we watch the lane equilibrium and if needed, we wait for the next creep wave and do it again
  - Block any creep wave to its fullest to try to create a double wave
- When in a dangerous part of the map, last hit only the ranged creeps to delay the creep wave and attempt to create a double creep wave at the enemy tower
- In the early game, if we see a lane without a team mate, we go tjere to take the farm
- Imform constantly what items our enemies have
- Verificar as fontes de lotus
- Ver os timmings dos tormentors etc
- ajudar o core a dar denies
- Canalizar/converter constantemente os Outpoats inimigos no triangulo deles
- Verificar se os inimigos tem mana
- Maybe it is good to put disconnected heroes to farm
- Imvestigar se o inimigo tem jungle camp stacks para podermos roubar
- When an enemy is low in HP in the early game, check if they have stick, fairy fire an lotus (detecting possible baiting)
- Place wards when wars start for superiority of vision
- When placing wards, consider blocking camps with them
- aways check your enemy lane items, and go on keep checking
- GIVE SENTRIES TO YOUR SLARK, he is a moving sentry too 
- At minute 00:00 check at mid tower's edge if the tower has visibility over you (must be during nighy) to see if enemy already placed vision there
- when in a fight, check your team mate items and press their magic wands
- We can use our currier to deliver our salves to our team mates as if our currier was theirs
- Buy centries and give to cores
- Buy gem and give to cores
- If you must return to base early, and need to WALK back to lane, you can use a smoke to go faster, but that prevents you from using them to gank
- Smoke of deceit could and should be used in combination with radar
- Use a smoke of deceit every time you see the enemy team play 3 lanes, so that you know the are split... Or you dont see the enemy carry for a long time in an area

- Chegar o curreie o mais para fora da fonte possivel para entregar coisas rapido
- Fazer uso do radar
- For each patch, you must know where to plant your iron branches to block the path among the trees that you just got into... The path that your enemy now has blocked because you planted a tree and that enabled you to escape from them

- In team fights, if you have a blight stone (reduces armor for X seconds) and a hero with fast right-click like lina or nature's prophet, you can also click each enemy one to enable your team's damage
- In team fights we should ping the hero to focus damage
