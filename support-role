  - Maybe we need to steal creeps by cutting their wave
- Prevent the enemy support from balancing the lane for himself
  - Sometimes the item WindLace helps a lot to contest 
- Respawn
   - Refil BOTTLEs of our mid laners when we respawn (by TP to mid)
   - Carry our core's item to side lane if good comunication happens and he drops the item on the fountain to be carried by us instead of the currier
- get away from our core as much as possible to prevent stealling his XP

- Around 20 min mark, check your carry's items timmings, and if his items are already built, remind the whole team to take roshan and to pressure towers after that 
- Keep our core full health full mana
- Block first creep wave at minute 00:00 for our offlaner all the way from the base to the enemy lane. If we die, we watch the lane equilibrium and if needed, we wait for the next creep wave and do it again
  - Block any creep wave to its fullest to try to create a double wave
- When in a dangerous part of the map, last hit only the ranged creeps to delay the creep wave and attempt to create a double creep wave at the enemy tower

- When placing wards, consider blocking camps with them
- aways check your enemy lane items, and go on keep checking
- GIVE SENTRIES TO YOUR SLARK, he is a moving sentry too 
- At minute 00:00 check at mid tower's edge if the tower has visibility over you (must be during nighy) to see if enemy already placed vision there

- Fazer uso do radar
- For each patch, you must know where to plant your iron branches to block the path among the trees that you just got into... The path that your enemy now has blocked because you planted a tree and that enabled you to escape from them
